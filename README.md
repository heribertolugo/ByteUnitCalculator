# ByteUnitCalculator
Calculator for adding and subtracting byte units.

Purposely designed with no external dependencies for portability and offline use.
Inspired by the need to quickly calculate if there is enough space on a target medium when copying/moving files in Windows machine.
File properties often gives different unit of measurement depending on file size,
for example: an image might display a file size of 1.5 MB and a document can display a file size of 1.69 KB.
If space on a target medium is a concern when moving or copying files, one may want to know the sum of the previous 2 files without having to convert the units into a normalized unit to get a total size.
You can select multiple files to see the sum under properties, but my issue was grabbing files from different folders.

This was a "one off" tool which served its purpose a long time ago.
Uploading to repository for historical and mostly nostalgic reasons.
